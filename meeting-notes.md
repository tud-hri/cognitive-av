- Check on existing literature (human factors) on implicit communication (e.g. through behavior)
  - Check Joost's and Pavlo's literature on pedestrian crossing, eHMI
  - Pavlo B did and experiment with pedestrian crossing and oncoming cars with different acceleration profiles in Japan with Nissan
- Focus of the experiments: 
  - show that for the extremes (e.g. constant decelleration or constant acceleration, less/no ambiguity exists for the vehicle)
  - then focus on ambiguous decision area: but for the 0->{-3, 0, 3}, there's ambiguity. More repetitions
  - Even focus only on TTA = 5, d = {30, 60} conditions and use the other TTA (with higher vel) again as check for alignment with Arkady's paper.
  - Mix in 25% of throw away trials for diversity. 
  - Start with 2D, and move on to 3D if easy to implement -> for ecological validity (e.g. 3D acceleration perception?) -> also talk to Pavlo.
