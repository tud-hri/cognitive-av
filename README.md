## Installation

You need a couple of python packages to run the code. To install them, we advise you to create a python environment first, for this specific project. If you don't want to, skip these instructions:

```python
python -m venv venv
``` 
You probably need to activate the environment (sometimes this happens automatically, check whether the command line in a terminal starts with `(venv)`):
```python
venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # windows
source venv/bin/activate   # unix/macos
```
Check if the command line starts with `(venv)`, which means that the virtual environment is activated.

Install the python packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
